### Hi there 👋🏼
I'm Rohan, a web developer by hobby and a current business & computer science student at the University of Toronto. I like meeting new people, making friends, travelling, playing tennis, and learning about new things. I wrote my first line of code around the age of 10 and have been intruged by the impact that computer science can have ever since. I love talking about the financial markets, global economy, and future trends.
